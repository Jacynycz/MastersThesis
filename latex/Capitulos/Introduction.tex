Scientific research nowadays is based on publications in scientific journals
with a high impact rate. This impact is managed by private companies that are
dedicated to benefit from the work of researchers This poses two important
problems when it comes to entering the world of academic research:

The first is that scientific journals that want to maintain their impact index,
have to make sure that the articles that come out in their issues have a large
number of citations, so they are always going to look for novel and high-impact
articles. Therefore, the editors of these journals will have a network of reviewers
on which they can trust to review the article. qs
