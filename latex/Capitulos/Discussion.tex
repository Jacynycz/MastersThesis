As a result of the development of this platform, the ideal scenario would be
that journals with impact factors like the mentioned \emph{JCR} adopt this
system. There are some important points to consider if this platform becomes
widely used.

\subsection{Other Problems}
\label{sec:other-problems}

  evolution}

Another problem is that the proposed technologies still have little expansion
and are little known by the average user.

For current researchers, a change of platform can be an inconvenience, since
today's technologies such as \ii{Easychair}\footnote{https://easychair.org/} can
be difficult to replace. Proposing a change in the communication and revision
systems can generate a great initial rejection, taking the project to a dead
end, especially since today's methods to connect to Ethereum's blockchain are
still complex. As a possible solution, Decentralized Science could be deployed
as a demo in small and less know journals to introduce this system to the
academic community. If one journal adopts this technology, it can be spread to
other small journals, trying to extend this system as a substitute of the widely
used ones. Furthermore, in order to improve the Ethereum's usability, a small
framework to enhance user experience can be developed.

Another problem relating to the technology is that Ethereum's cryptocurrency
fluctuates a lot, and lately, there has been a rise in all cryptocurrency prices
compared to a year ago\footnote{According to http://coincap.io/}. As shown in
the figure \ref{prob:txfee} this price affects transactions, which may cause an
increase of the prices to interact with the platform.


\section{Monetary Impact}
\label{sec:monetary-impact}

The monetary impact would be one of the most notable after the implementation of
this system in today's scientific publishing systems. According to research
data, the cost of publishing an article in a open access journal with a high
impact index varies from 1,000 to 5,000
euros~\cite{van2013true,russel2008business}, a cost that is often not feasible
for researchers who want to advance in scientific research. In the other hand,
the costs of reading papers published in non open access journals is usually
unfair and expensive as explored in section~\ref{scb:ps}.

The cost of publication and access to science through the proposed work would
only vary depending on the price of the cryptocurrency used by Ethereum (see
section~\ref{tech:sec:ethereum}}). As seen in section~\ref{arch:trans}, the
maximum cost of a transaction in all the publication process would be a few
euros. Bearing in mind that for a paper to be published at least 5 transactions
must be carried out, it can be determined that the current price for publishing
a paper is around 2 euros according to Ethereum Gas Station\footnote{Price of a
  transaction in Ethereum https: //ethgasstation.info/}, more than 500 times
cheaper than the publishing system mentioned before.

\section{Impact in the scientific community}
\label{sec:science-distribution}

Another important impact would be the reduction of time and the increase of
quality in the process of peer review. If a critical mass of researchers use the
proposed platform, the peer review process would be affected in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \itbf{Improvement in the review time:} Smart contracts allow establishing time
  limits for the review of an article, assuming a penalty to reviewers who do
  not meet these deadlines (see section~\ref{archAndDes}). If a Decentralized
  Journal has defined certain review times, and reviewers who are assigned
  accept the review proposal, it is likely that there will be an improvement in
  the delivery time of the reviews. Therefore the publication process will be
  faster regarding the delivery times of the reviews of today's publishing
  systems~\cite{huisman2017duration}.

  \itbf{Improvement in the review quality:} All reviews are rated by the
  community and directly affect the reputation of the reviewer. In this scenario
  it is likely that the quality of the reviews in the system will suffer an
  improvement and some problems regarding the peer review discussed in section
  \ref{intro} may be alliviated.
\end{enumerate}

All interaction with the platform must be done through an Ethereum account and
recorded in its blockchain. This would imply that through the address of a
researcher you can obtain all the papers this researcher have published and
reviewed. The entire scientific community could improve thanks to this platform
because an Ethereum address could be used as an accreditation system. In
addition, new researchers who want to start their career in academia can gain
visibility thanks to the reputation system.

If the system were implemented successfully, the scientific community could
begin to question the existence of the publishers and new forms of project
funding could be found.


Finally, all the code developed for this platform is open source, meaning that
it is totally free and accessible through the project github\footnote{Available
  at https://decentralized.science}. This implies several important things:

\begin{itemize}
\item Review submission, reputation system, journal delivery times and paper
  storage can be changed to other alternatives, allowing journals and
  conferences implement their own protocols and systems.
\item The code can be improved and reviewed by other developers, opening
  submissions to find vulnerabilities and better implementations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Platform legitimization}

One of the main objectives is to legitimize the platform. offering the
possibility to accredit the career of a researcher with the information contained
in the system.

No matter how much reputation a user has or how many papers she has published,
if accrediting entities such as the aforementioned ANECA (see section~\ref{scb})
do not accept this system, these potential users will continue to use the
current publication systems.

It would be possible to change this paradigm if any of these entities formed an
alliance with the project. Maybe in the future, in order to prove that a person
can teach in the university, she would only have to provide her Ethereum
address.
