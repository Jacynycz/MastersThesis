As a result of the development of this platform, the ideal scenario would be that journals with impact factors like the mentioned \emph{JCR} adopt this system.
There are some important points to consider if this platform becomes widely used.

\subsection{Other Problems}

Another problem is that the proposed technologies still have little expansion and are little known by the average user.

For current researchers, a change of platform can be an inconvenience, since today's technologies such as \ii{easychair}\footnote{https://easychair.org/} can be difficult to replace. Proposing a change in the communication and revision systems can suppose a great initial rejection, taking the project to a dead end, especially if today's methods to connect to Ethereum's blockchain are still complex.

Ethereum's cryptocurrency fluctuates a lot, and lately, there has been a rise in all cryptocurrencies' prices compared to a year ago\footnote{According to http://coincap.io/}. As shown in the figure \ref{prob:txfee} this price affects transactions, which may cause an increase of the prices to interact with the platform.


\section{Monetary Impact}

The monetary impact would be one of the most notable after the implementation of this system in today's scientific publishing systems. According to research data, the cost of publishing an article in a magazine with a high impact index varies from 1,000 to 5,000 euros\cite{van2013true,russel2008business}, a cost that is often not feasible for researchers who want to advance in scientific research.

The cost of publication and access to science through the proposed work would only vary depending on the price of the cryptocurrency used by Ethereum (see section \ref{tech:sec:ethereum}}). As seen in section~\ref{arch:trans}, the maximum cost of a transaction in all the publication process would be euros. Bearing in mind that for a paper to be published at least 5 transactions must be carried out, it can be determined that the current price for publishing a paper is around 2 euros according to Ethereum Gas Station \footnote{Price of a transaction in Ethereum https: //ethgasstation.info/}, more than 500 times cheaper than the publishing system mentioned before.

Another important impact would be the reduction of time and the increase of quality in the process of peer review. If a critical mass of researchers use the proposed platform, the peer review process would be affected in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\itbf{Improvement in the review time:} Smart contracts allow establishing time limits for the review of an article, assuming a penalty to reviewers who do not meet these deadlines (see section \ref{reputation}). If a Decentralized Journal has defined certain review times, and reviewers who are assigned accept the review proposal, it is likely that there will be an improvement in the delivery time of the reviews. Therefore in the publication process will be faster regarding the delivery times of the reviews of today's publishing systems~\cite{huisman2017duration}.

\itbf{Improvement in the review quality:} All reviews are rated by the community and directly affect the reputation of the reviewer, so it is highly likely that the quality of the reviews in the system will suffer an improvement and many of the problems regarding the peer review discussed in section \ref{intro} will disappear.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Science Distribution}

All interaction with the platform must be done through an Ethereum account and recorded in its blockchain. This would imply that through the address of a scientific researcher you can obtain all the papers this researcher have published and reviewed. The entire scientific community could improve thanks to this platform because an Ethereum address could be used as an accreditation system. In addition, new researchers who want to start their career in academia can gain visibility thanks to the reputation system.

If the system were implemented successfully, the scientific community would begin to question the existence of the publishers, and if they disappeared, new forms of project financing would be found.
