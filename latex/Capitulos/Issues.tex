  privacy models}

Anonymity of reviewers and authors in peer reviews is traditionally used to
improve the fairness of the process. Thanks to single blind reviews, anonymous
reviewers can honestly criticize a paper without fearing the reactions of the
authors. Double blind reviews also allow to reduce the impact of personal
biases. Finally, open review models propose that both authors and reviewers know
each other. These different privacy settings are shown in the Figure
\ref{PrivacyReviewRating}. Nevertheless, the anonymity of the reviewers can also
be abused. Unfair or low quality reviews were not discouraged by the system due
to the lack of consequences.

\subsection{Privacy for the peer review process}
\label{sec:privacy-peer-review}

As mentioned in previous sections, all the information is stored in either IPFS
(files) or Ethereum (interactions). All this information is public for everyone,
which can be privacy problem for the reviewers if they do not want to reveal
their identity. Exploring different possible configurations for each model of
peer review may solve this problem.

Each of the anonymity options of the system requires different solutions, which
are discussed bellow. The question of whether we can keep the benefits of blind
review while providing accountability and recognition to reviews deserves
special consideration.

\subsubsection*{Blind peer review}
Blind review is the protection of the identity of reviewers in the peer review
process. This way, anonymous reviewers can honestly criticize a paper without
fearing the reactions of the authors. In a blockchain, this protection could be
easily achieved by using single-use addresses previously agreed with the editor.

\subsubsection*{Double blinded peer review}
A double blinded review is a blind review that additionally protects the authors
identity to prevent social bias~\cite{lee2013bias,budden2008double}. Authors
could protect their identities prior to publication by providing a single-use
public address on submission. Later they can reveal their real identity since
they are the only ones with access to that address.

\subsubsection*{Open peer review}

Open review models propose that both authors and reviewers know each
other~\cite{ford2013defining}. While studies found effect on the percentage of
reviewers declining to review~\cite{van1999effect} other implications remain
open to debate~\cite{groves2010open}.

% Different privacy settings for peer review have been discussed in the previous
% subsection.
This section builds on the previous section, adding a new layer of complexity:
we do not only deal with reviews, but with both reviews and ratings. As already
proposed in Section~\ref{rep:system}, the construction of a reputation network
of reviewers may improve the accountability of the peer review process. Thus,
this section explores the different privacy settings such reputation systems may
have. One of these settings, the rating of blind reviews, is explored in more
detail. Challenges of such system are identified, and will later guide Section
\ref{sec:realizing} discussion on how it may be achieved.

% where review reports are rated by authors, reviewers and editors. The possible
% privacy settings of this system are presented in the following subsections.

\subsection*{Signed Rating}
% \comat{TODO: use signed vs anonymous rating and open vs blind review, double
% check this naming through all the paper} \comsa{This needs more explanation,
% since "open" is ambiguous. It means publicly visible? by those in the network,
% by google, by who? etc; "open" doesn't mean identifiable raters and
% identifiable reviewers, if you mean that, explain it; and btw "open reviews"
% is unclear also. }
Similarly to the open peer review (explained in the previous section), signed
ratings are public and verified ratings of a review. It is straight forward to
implement by maintaining a public identity for the raters.

\subsection*{Anonymous Rating}

Protecting the identity of raters is interesting in several reputation systems
~\cite{schaub2016trustless}. We can support this anonymity feature using
\emph{blinded tokens}~\cite{schaub2016trustless} that grant permission to rate
without revealing the identity of the rater. People authorized to rate a review
in the system, e.g. authors, editors and other reviewers of the paper involved
in the process, may each get one of these tokens.
% \comsa{why are those the authorized and not others? who defines that?
% where?}\comat{rewriten as an example, so there is n need to justify :)}

\subsection*{Rating Blind Reviews}

The question of whether we can keep the benefits of blind review while providing
accountability and recognition to reviewers (and thus rating their reviews)
deserves special consideration.

The following challenges must be considered in order to provide this privacy
setting:
\begin{enumerate}

  \itbf{Anonymity:}\label{ch:anonymity} The reviewer should be able to claim the
  rating received in her review (e.g. to receive positive reputation) without
  revealing that she is the author of the review.

  \itbf{Accountability:} \label{ch:accountability} The reviewer should not be
  able to avoid the effect of negative reviews (e.g. claiming just the positive
  ratings).
  

  \itbf{Authorization:} \label{ch:authorization} The ratings should come from
  authorized raters (i.e. minimizing cheating).


  \itbf{Sybil resistance:} \label{ch:sybil} Having several identities in the
  system should not provide advantages. Note blockchain systems such as Ethereum
  allow the creation of multiple identities per user.


  \itbf{System abuses:} \label{ch:abuses} The anonymity of the interactions may
  hinder the detection and prevention of system abuses. For instance, malicious
  actors may try to submit fake reviews to be rated by accounts they control in
  order to get unfair good ratings. Detecting this behavior would not be trivial
  since reviews and ratings may be anonymous.

\end{enumerate}

A system allowing an anonymous, yet accountable, reputation system for peer
reviewing would enable a new privacy and accountability model for peer review.
However, its implementation face important challenges such as those described
above. Next section provides an overview of how existing techniques may be
applied to tackle the identified
challenges. %\comsa{are the above sections part of this subsection? unclear, confusing}

\subsection{Achieving Accountable Anonymous Reviews}\label{sec:realizing}

The previous section identifies challenges that an anonymous yet accountable
reputation system for peer reviews face. Some existing technologies have been
applied to similar challenges, and others may help to combine their advantages.
This section explains these technologies and how they may be used to tackle the
challenges of this system. First it provides an overview of how the technologies
may be combined, and afterwards a description of the technologies follows.

A simple way of protecting the identity of users is the use of different virtual
identities for each interaction, i.e. \emph{single-use identities}. However,
linking the reputation received by this single-use identities to their real
identity both providing accountability (Challenge \ref{ch:accountability}) and
preserving the anonymity (Challenge \ref{ch:anonymity}) require the use of other
technologies.

In order to provide accountability (Challenge \ref{ch:accountability}), the
system may try to detect when an identity has not claimed back a bad reputation.
For this purpose, a reputation deposit or \emph{collateral} could be requested
for each rating a reviewer may get. This way, users could compare the number of
claimed ratings and the number of unclaimed ratings, and assume bad ratings for
those that are missing. This collateral-based technique should be applied
carefully, avoiding abuses such as trying to use the same collateral for
different ratings. Advanced cryptographic techniques such as \emph{zk-SNARKs}
(explained below) may help to prove that these requirements are met without
compromising the reviewers' identity. These techniques may be used to allow a
reviewer to claim a rating from a review she did without revealing her identity
but proving her authorship (Challenge \ref{ch:anonymity}).

A different issue is to allow ratings to come solely from authorized raters
(Challenge \ref{ch:authorization}). To attend these authorization requirements,
several techniques such as \emph{blind signatures} or \emph{blind tokens} may be
used. These would enable to grant permission to a collection of identities to
perform an action, e.g. rate a review, without revealing which of them voted, or
which voted for what. As previously, \emph{single-use identities} may be used to
provide anonymity; in this case, for raters.

Allowing only authorized rates, as previously explained, may help to prevent
Sybil attacks (Challenge \ref{ch:sybil}). Moreover, the cost of losing a
reputable identity may reduce the attractiveness of starting a new identity just
for the sake of reputation.

The use of the mentioned zk-SNARKs may also help to prevent some system abuses.
For instance by enabling the use of cryptographic proofs that verify that the
ratings come from reviews submitted to reputable journals, would prevent fake
reviews and ratings.

Next, the previously mentioned technologies are explained.

\begin{description}
\item[Single-use identities] New single-use identities may be used as a simple
  technique to support anonymous interactions (Challenge~\ref{ch:anonymity}).
  However, supporting the authorization rules of the system
  (Challenge~\ref{ch:authorization}) and providing accountability
  (Challenge~\ref{ch:accountability}) for those identities are challenges that
  require consideration.

\item[Ring signatures] Ring signatures \cite{rivest2001leak} are a cryptographic
  technique that allows to authorize a collection of identities to perform an
  action, while keeping the privacy of the specific identity that performed the
  action. They may be used to authorize rates to a group of identities, e.g. the
  authorized raters, without revealing who rated what or who rated. Thus, this
  technique may be used to support the authorization requirements of the system
  (Challenge~\ref{ch:authorization}), while providing some anonymity to the
  users (Challenge~\ref{ch:anonymity}). Note that with this technique, the
  identities of who may have signed are known, so the combination with other
  anonymity measures could be of interest.

\item[Blind tokens] In the context of an election and using a cryptographic
  technique called blind signatures~\cite{chaum1983blind}, it is possible to
  create ballots for authorized actors that preserve the anonymity of the vote
  (both hiding who casted a vote and what each actor voted) but ensuring that
  only authorized voters participated. Note that, as with ring signatures, the
  identities of who may signed are known, and thus complementary anonymity
  measures could be used. This technique has been also used to anonymize a
  distributed reputation system~\cite{schaub2016trustless}. Thus, it could be
  used to provide anonymity to reviewers and raters
  (Challenge~\ref{ch:anonymity}) while supporting the authorization rules of the
  system, i.e. who may submit a review or a rating
  (Challenge~\ref{ch:authorization}).

\item[Collateral pattern] In order to secure the funds needed for a blockchain
  application to function, it is common that the application requests the
  participants to pay as collateral the assets they may lose. For instance, a
  betting smart contract will first ask all participants to pay their bets and
  afterwards distribute the prices. This paper calls this technique "collateral
  pattern", and proposes its use to provide accountability (Challenge
  \ref{ch:accountability}) to the reviewers of the reputation system (Section
  \ref{sec:reputation}). For each rating a reviewer may obtain, the reviewer
  must spend as much reputation as she may lose. This encourages the claiming of
  bad ratings, since not claiming them may result in a bigger loss.
  % \comse{No queda claro como se podría participar en el sistema por primera
  % vez, sin reputación que poner en collateral. No tenemos solución, lo
  % enumeraría como problema a solucionar.}\comat{Es cierto, aunque no se si
  % necesitamos dar tanto nivel de detalle aquí}

\item[zk-SNARK] is a cryptographic procedure enabling to prove a statement
  without revealing anything else, i.e. apart from the evaluation if the
  statement is in fact true (zero-knowledge proof of
  knowledge)~\cite{blum1988non,bitansky2013succinct}. The same authors also
  provide this property in a succinct and non-interactive fashion, i.e. using a
  relatively small proof and not requiring further communication between prover
  and verifier. In fact, the popular ZCash project uses this technology to build
  an anonymous cryptocurrency~\cite{sasson2014zerocash}. Proving statements in
  this privacy preserving manner is of great interest for several challenges of
  the proposed accountable anonymous review system. For instance, proving that a
  user controls a single-use identity (explained above) may allow the user to
  claim the reputation given to that identity (Challenge \ref{ch:anonymity}).
  Additionally, a reviewer may prove that she payed the reputation collateral
  (explained above) needed to submit a review without revealing her identity and
  without being able to use the same collateral for another review (Challenge
  \ref{ch:accountability}). Finally, proving that the reputation comes from a
  review submitted to a collection of honest journals that do not allow abuses,
  may help to mitigate the abuses that fake reviews and ratings represents for
  the system (Challenge \ref{ch:abuses}).

  % \item[Reusable payment codes] is a technique that enables the possibility of
  %   using a large amount of addresses to receive a payment
  %   ~\cite{harrigan2016unreasonable, ranvierReusable}. Reviewers may share one
  %   of these addresses with each of the actors with permission to rate and
  %   then collect the reputation probably using an anonymity layer such as coin
  %   mixing ~\cite{meiklejohn2015privacy}. \comsa{and more concepts!! anonymity
  %   layer? coin mixing?} Using a collateral model would encourage the
  %   acceptance of bad ratings.


\end{description}



% \emph{Coin mixing} protocols are designed to obfuscate the relation between
% senders and receivers of Bitcoin payments by mixing in a single transaction
% many senders and receivers ~\cite{meiklejohn2015privacy}. We can not directly
% apply this approach to rate reviews since the receiver identity is known.
% However it can be used in collaboration with other techniques discussed below.
