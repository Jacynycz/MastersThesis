We propose a blockchain-enabled decentralized publication system for open
science. It consists of three main components that decentralize and try to
improve three different aspects related to scientific publication:

1) Peer review governance communication is traditionally centralized and
controlled by editors and publishers. Our proposal opens and decentralizes these
communications making the process more transparent.

2) Peer reviewer quality and reliability information is difficult to
predict~\cite{callaham_relationship_2007}, and it is usually hold private by
publishers and journals. The system proposes to open this information through a
decentralized reputation network of peer reviewers over a blockchain.

3) Scientific papers are traditionally obtained or bought from a centralized
publisher. We propose a decentralized network to distribute academic works and
promote free access to science.

These ideas are further discussed in the following sections.

\section{Transparent Peer Review Governance}
\label{workflow}

The system provides a platform for the peer review process communication, from
paper submission to paper acceptance or rejection. It registers all the
interactions into a blockchain based distributed
ledger. % and provides open access to all relevant content, from the different versions of the paper to the submitted reviews.

The interaction diagram of the system (Figure \ref{InteractionDiagram})
describes the interactions of the supported peer review governance. Following,
this interactions and their implementation are described.

  interaction}

\begin{LaTeXdescription}
\item[Paper submission] A paper submission is registered by submitting the IPFS
  address of the paper to an Ethereum contract. Then, the Ethereum sender
  address is recorded as the corresponding author, and the submission is
  timestamped in the blockchain.

\item[Reviewer proposal] A journal editor may invite a peer reviewer to review a
  specific paper. The transaction will record the Ethereum address of the
  reviewer and optionally, a deadline to submit the review.

\item[Reviewer acceptance/rejection] An invited reviewer may accept or reject
  the review of a paper. The response will be recorded into the blockchain.

\item[Submit review] A reviewer should make a transaction to deliver the review.
  The transaction will record the acceptance/rejection and the IPFS address of
  the detailed review.

\item[Rate review] A novelty of the system further discussed in Section
  \ref{reputation} is the rating system for reviews. The transaction will record
  the sender address and the rating as well as the rated review and reviewer
  addresses.
\end{LaTeXdescription}

\section{The Peer Review Reputation network}
\label{reputation}

The system proposes the use of a peer review reputation network were the quality
of peer reviews is rated by the authors, editors and reviewers of the system.
The work extends traditional peer review governance with the possibility of
rating the reviews, building a reputation system for
reviewers~\cite{resnick2000reputation}. Reviewers get rewarded for worthy, fair,
an timely reviews, or penalized otherwise.

This network of peer reviewers would enable a better reviewer selection, a fair
recognition of reviewers work and a protection against unfair reviews for
authors. However, it could also rise privacy concerns for both reviewers and
raters~\cite{van1999effect,schaub2016trustless}. We consider these privacy
issues in section \ref{privacy}.

% With this network of rated peer reviews, different metrics of the peer
% reviewers can be provided by the system. Journals can benefit from this
% network by searching for well rated reviewers that respond on time, authors
% can expect shorter review time and forget about unaccountable bad reviews and
% reviewers can get their work publicly recognized. This approach can suppose a
% privacy problem for both reviewers and raters. We contemplate these problems
% and how to solve them in section \ref{PrivacyReviewRating}.

Each time a user of the platform sends a review, it will be rateable. This way,
each reviewer will obtain a score of each one of the reviews he sends, building
the reviewers' reputation system. Initially, the people who can vote are the
authors of the paper, the editors who have assigned the reviewers, and the other
reviewers of the article. But in future implementations, rating a review will be
public.

There are two main implications among others:

\begin{itemize}
  \itbf{The cold start problem for new papers and researchers:} Normally papers
  that are published in journals or conferences of low impact take a long time
  to gain visibility in the scientific community. However, if a reviewer
  reputation system is used, if three reviewers with a high reputation make a
  favorable review for a paper for a little-known journal, it is likely to have
  more visibility since the reputation of the reviewers can positively influence
  the impact of the papers in the scientific community.
  
  \itbf{Pay-per-review:} In most cases nowadays, the reviewers do not obtain any
  economic benefit for carrying out the revision of a paper. By implementing a
  reputation system, pay-per-review dynamics could be formed, in which the most
  reputable reviewers are paid for performing reviews at the request of the
  journal or the authors. This is an incentive for all reviewers of the system
  to make good reviews and gain reputation. In addition, since all interactions
  are in Ethereum, payments and deliveries confirmations can be made through
  personalized smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries, and making the
  process transparent and honest.
 
\end{itemize}


\section{Distributed Open Access infrastructure}
\label{distributedOA}
% \commant{Copied from PEERE Paper.TODO rewrite}
Open Access focuses in the free access to scientific knowledge. While publishers
provide free of charge their Open Access content, their control of the science
dissemination infrastructure allows them to impose certain rules, such as
charging authors unreasonable fees to offer their work as Open
Access~\cite{solomon2012study} (Gold Open Access) or the temporal embargo and
restrictions on the dissemination of the final version (Green Open
access)~\cite{bjork2014anatomy}, among others.

The system proposes a decentralized infrastructure for science publication.
Academic documents - from first drafts to final versions, including peer
reviews- are shared in IPFS, as mentioned on section~\ref{tech:sec:ipfs}. Thus,
the system inherently grants Open Access by the design of its distributed
infrastructure and circumvents the publishers dominant role.

All the documents are first uploaded to IPFS, generating a \emph{Base58}
address. Then the system uses this address to make a transaction in Ethereum,
cryptographically signing the contract with the user's address. Other users that
want to access the paper, only have to inspect the blockchain, retrieve the IPFS
address and download it though a local node or a gateway. This makes
Decentralized Science a truly open-access publication system, were all the
process is public, transparent and trustful.
